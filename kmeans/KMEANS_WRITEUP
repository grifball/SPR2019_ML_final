Realized after picking kmeans that it would probably find a different metric than malware/benign
Ran the tests anyway
using 10000 unlabeled points, 1000 positive, 1000 negative
Used PCA to reduce the unlabeled data down to 2 dimensions
Used kmeans to train 2 centroids on the PCA'd data
Used resulting model to predict data (after applying same PCA to each labeled datapoint)
got 50% accuracy
graphed the points (based on their PCA coordinates)
noticed that the y-axis did a better job sorting benign from malware than the x-axis did
The result of the kmeans training usually just uses the x-axis to separate the data points
Ran accuracy tests using only the y-axis
got 60% accuracy
TODO:
	figure out what the x-axis actually measures
	maybe use a different unsupervised scheme? (or more centroids?)
