to run the current ML model, you just have to download the EMBER dataset from here:
https://pubdata.endgame.com/ember/ember_dataset.tar.bz2
and extract it to this repo (it should extract to ./ember)
Now "preprocess" the data with this command: (split it into small chunks of training/testing)
python3 preprocess.py
Make sure you have numpy
This should create two files: ./training.jsonl and ./testing.jsonl
You can now train and test the model with:
python3 train.py
This script simply takes each test point and checks if the first import matches a data point in the training data.
This script will output the accuracy of the model.
